/// kept as a switch rather than removed: the next "it is slow on my
/// machine" report wants exactly this log, and asking someone to
/// install a special build to produce it is far worse than a checkbox.
///
/// The Rust side owns the on/off decision (`crate::diag`), so this
/// always sends and the command drops the line when logging is off.
/// Duplicating the flag here would mean two sources of truth for one
/// setting, and the IPC call is cheap against the work being measured.
///
/// Writes through the Rust side so frontend and backend lines land in
/// ONE file, in order. That ordering is the whole point: the reported
/// symptom is a view that takes over a minute while the same search runs
/// in seconds from `gh`, and the only way to tell a slow request from a
/// slow render is to see React's timestamps interleaved with the
/// request's.

/// change the behaviour they are measuring, so a failed log is dropped.
