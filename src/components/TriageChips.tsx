/// Clickable counters above the list.

/// `applyFilters` has supported these five predicates since M3 and
/// `deriveStats` has counted four of them, but nothing rendered either --
/// the triage knowledge existed, was tested, and had no surface. This is
/// the surface. Counts come from the SAME predicates the filters apply, so
/// a chip's number can never disagree with the list it opens.
///
/// Each chip REPLACES the filter set rather than adding to it, so a click
/// never inherits a filter the user forgot was active and lands on a list
/// that contradicts the count they just clicked. `repo` is carried through
/// because it is navigation, not a filter.
///
/// The pressed-state predicate lives in `@/lib/chipPressed`, shared with
/// `ReviewChips`: it was local and unexported here, so the sibling could
/// not inherit it and shipped the very subset test this one documents
/// fixing (#971).
