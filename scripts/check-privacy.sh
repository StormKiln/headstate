# Headstate is a public repo. At runtime it queries every org the user can
# see -- that is the product. But committed files must never name a private
# or employer repository, because a leak here is permanent and public.
#
# This is an ALLOW-list, deliberately. A deny-list would have to spell out
# the very names it exists to keep out, putting them in the repo in plain
# text and defeating itself. An allow-list also catches owners nobody
# thought to enumerate.
#
# Patterns are anchored so they cannot match ordinary prose. An earlier
# unanchored `owner/repo` pattern matched things like `api/hooks.ts`,
# `read/write`, and `5000/hour` -- a gate that cries wolf gets disabled, so
# anchoring is load-bearing, not tidiness. The patterns themselves live at
# the scan() calls below.
#
# WHAT THIS GUARD DOES NOT CATCH: a BARE LOGIN. Every pattern below keys
# off a syntactic marker -- a URL scheme, an `@` host, a `#N` suffix, a
# known SaaS domain, a `code/`-style parent. A real colleague's login
# written on its own ("reviewed by jdoe", `reviewers: ["jdoe"]`) carries
# no such marker, so it passes silently. Green here means "no MARKED
# private reference", never "no identities committed".
#
# That gap is accepted as a REVIEW responsibility, deliberately, and the
# alternative was considered and rejected rather than overlooked. A bare
# login is lexically a bare word: `jdoe` is indistinguishable from prose,
# from a variable name, and from the synthetic logins fixtures are
# supposed to use. Any pattern broad enough to catch one matches every
# identifier in the repo, which is the unanchored-`owner/repo` mistake
# recorded above -- ~40 false positives, and a gate that cries wolf is a
# gate someone disables. Narrowing it instead to a deny-list of real
# logins would print those logins in a public file, which is the same
# self-defeat the allow-list design above exists to avoid.
#
# So the rule lives in CONTRIBUTING.md ("The privacy rule", which names
# the synthetic set: octocat/hello-world, octocat/spoon-knife) and is
# enforced by a human reading the diff. #833 found real colleague logins
# in test fixtures precisely this way. If you are reviewing: fixtures
# and `*.test.*` files naming a person are the place to look, because
# that is where the found instances were.
