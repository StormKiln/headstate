//! Poetry's virtualenv cache.
//!
//! Poetry names a venv `<project>-<hash>-py<X.Y>`, where the hash is
//! `base64(sha256(absolute project path))[:8]`. That naming is what makes
//! this tractable: the hash is a pure function of the path, so we can
//! reconstruct it for every directory we know about and ask whether any
//! of them produced a given venv.
//!
//! It also explains why the cache grows without bound on a machine that
//! uses worktrees. Every worktree is a different absolute path, so every
//! worktree gets its OWN venv -- and deleting the worktree leaves the
//! venv behind forever. On the machine this was built for, one project
//! that no longer exists on disk at all accounted for 70 venvs and
//! 54.9 GB, against 90 venvs and 57 GB in total.
