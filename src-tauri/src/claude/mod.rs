//! Claude Code sessions: what Headstate knows about them and where it
//! learned it.
//!
//! Epic #910. Today this holds the transcript importer (#914), which is
//! the source that works retroactively: `~/.claude/projects` already
//! contains every session that ever ran on the machine, so the Claude
//! Code view opens with real history rather than an empty list waiting
//! for a hook to fire.
//!
//! The hook path (#912, #913) is the other source and will land beside
//! this one. They meet in [`store`], which upserts on `session_id` and
//! resolves the overlap per field by which source actually knows the
//! answer -- see [`store::import`].
//!
//! Nothing in here writes to `~/.claude`. Read-only by design: those
//! transcripts are Claude Code's data and the file `claude --resume`
//! depends on.
