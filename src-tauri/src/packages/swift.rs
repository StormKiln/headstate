//! Swift packages, read from `Package.resolved`.
//!
//! `check` used to report, accurately, that no command answers this:
//! `xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies` resolves and does not diff,
//! and `swift package update --dry-run` only exists for a
//! `Package.swift`, not for Xcode-managed dependencies.
//!
//! That was true about COMMANDS and wrong about the question. Swift
//! packages are Git repositories and their versions are TAGS, so
//! "is there a newer one" is answerable without any Swift tooling:
//! `Package.resolved` gives the pin and the source URL, and the host
//! lists the tags. For the common case that host is GitHub, which this
//! app is already authenticated against.
//!
//! Checking and applying are separate: knowing a newer tag exists is not
//! knowing how to update an Xcode project's package reference, so apply
//! stays refused.
